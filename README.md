Monthly PDF Report Feature – Complete Docs Pack
(copy/paste into README, wiki, or GitHub release notes)
1. What it does
Every 1-st of the month at 08:00 the app automatically:
Collects last month’s expenses for every user that has an e-mail address.
Builds a 1-page PDF (category table + total).
E-mails the PDF as attachment to the user without any human click.

Q: I didn’t receive the e-mail.
A: Check spam. Ensure you added your address in Settings → Profile → E-mail.
Server logs: docker logs -f container or console where python app.py runs.
Q: Can I pick my own day?
A: Not yet UI-side; open app.py, edit the cron line, restart.
Q: PDF shows zero lines.
A: You had no expenses in that month – add one dated inside the range.
Q: Can I export older months?
A: Run manually:
```
bash
python -c "from monthly_report import job_monthly_reports; job_monthly_reports()"
```
Developer notes
WeasyPrint on Windows needs GTK3 runtime or the no-GTK wheel.
APScheduler is thread-safe with Flask context pushed inside the job.
Mail errors are printed to stdout (container / systemd journal).
PDF byte-stream is held in memory (io.BytesIO) – no temp files.
Unit-test friendly: all pure functions, no I/O in last_month_range(), generate_pdf().
